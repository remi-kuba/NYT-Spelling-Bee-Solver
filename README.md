# NYT Spelling Bee Solver
Solves the New York Times Spelling Bee using a simple trie implementation <br />

## Install and Running Solver
First clone the repository (run "git clone <repository url>") then run the fe.py file on your terminal (python fe.py). Once running, enter "[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)" into your search engine. <br />

There are two dictionaries available to choose from:<br />
1) A short dictionary "usa.txt" from [JUST WORDS!](http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm) <br />
2) A longer dictionary "word.txt" from the [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.git) <br />

As noted on the site, the NYT's dictionary is not known, so even though the long dictionary will contain extraneous words, it still may not give all solutions to the daily puzzle.
